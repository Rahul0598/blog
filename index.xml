      <description>Reading Langdon Winner&amp;rsquo;s The Whale and the Reactor today feels like looking in a mirror. Published in 1986, his thoughts on technology&amp;rsquo;s place in society resonate with an unsettling familiarity. The anxieties and arguments surrounding computers and nuclear power then are pretty similar to our conversations about Artificial Intelligence now. It seems we&amp;rsquo;re grappling with the same fundamental questions, just with a new set of tools.
The Inevitable Steamroller Winner criticized the idea of technology as an unstoppable force, a kind of progress we have no choice but to accept.</description>

      <description>The book details the multifaceted harm caused by roads, extending far beyond the estimated one million animals killed by vehicles daily in the U.S. alone. Roads fragment habitats, preventing creatures from migrating for food and mates; they serve as conduits for invasive species; and their associated salt runoff and traffic noise pollute ecosystems. Goldfarb showcases projects like wildlife bridges in California and tunnels for toads in England, demonstrating how thoughtful design can mitigate destructive effects.</description>
