      <description>Reading Langdon Winner&amp;rsquo;s The Whale and the Reactor today feels like looking in a mirror. Published in 1986, his thoughts on technology&amp;rsquo;s place in society resonate with an unsettling familiarity. The anxieties and arguments surrounding computers and nuclear power then are pretty similar to our conversations about Artificial Intelligence now. It seems we&amp;rsquo;re grappling with the same fundamental questions, just with a new set of tools.
The Inevitable Steamroller Winner criticized the idea of technology as an unstoppable force, a kind of progress we have no choice but to accept.</description>
